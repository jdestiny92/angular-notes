unit testing
------------------

- independent checking for proper operation of the smallest testable part of an application
- independent: isolated from the rest of the system
- smallest testable: means you have to approach all of code development from this perspective
	- i.e., won't work if you have one function that does everything
- should be repeatable


mocking
--------------

- technique where dependency and its behavior is imitated (or faked)
- can be done directly by developer or via mocking library


Jasmine
--------------

Steps for Jasmine-based (browser) Tests

- download and unzip Jasmin standalone into a directory
- erase everything in src and spec directories
- place your application code into the src directory
- place your test code or a spec into the spec directory
- update SpecRunner.html
	- replace references to erased src and spec files with your own
- start browser-sync or whatever you use for local server and go to http://..//SpecRunner.html to run specs


Writing a Spec (test)

<script>
	describe('My Function', function(){
		var initValue;

		// this is optional, this logic is run once before each spec is run
		beforeEach(function(){
			initValue = 'someVal';
		});

		it('should not return true', function(){
			var result = someFunction(initValue);

			expect(result).not.toBe(true);
		});
	});
</script>

- mocks are used to fake the dependencies of target code
- describe is used to group tests together
- beforeEach is used to initialize state before running each test
- it is used to run the actual test code
