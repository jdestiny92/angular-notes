Model-View-ViewModel

1. Model - represents and holds raw data (something from database or REST api calls, data/business logic)
	- some of this data may be displayed in the view
	- can also contain logic to retrieve the data from the source (http or ajax call)
	- contains no logic associated with displaying the model

2. View - user interface
	- web app: just html and css
	- declaritively broadcasts events, but never handles them (shouldn't write javascript code here)

3. ViewModel - representation of the state of the view (presenatation logic)
	- holds the data that is displayed in the view
	- responds to view events, aka presentation logic
	- calls other functionality for business logic processing
	- never asks the view to display anything (never directly manipulates the dom)

4. Declarative Binder - declaritively binds the model of the ViewModel to the View
	- the framework does its magic
