3 Major Routing:

Web 1.0 where every changed caused a hit to the server and had to refresh the page

Web 2.0, ajax call, where some changes are handled by the browser and not the server, thus no refresh needed

SPA = using #, on predefined states, which further lessens interaction with the server


Two Major Routing Technologies:

ngRoute
----------

- separate js file
- developed by google and community
- no concept of ui state
- every route must be represented by a url
- no concept of nested views
- ok for prototype projects


ui-router
-----------

- separate js file
- developed by community
- ui state is central
	- can have a route with no unique URL for that route
- URL routing is also supported
	- ui state is updated based on the URL
- nested views supported
- better choice for more serious projects


Step 1: Reference in HTML

<script src="lib/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="lib/angular-ui-router.min.js"></script>


Step 2: Place ui-view Initial View Placeholder

<body>
	...
	<ui-view></ui-view>
	...
</body>


Step 3: Declare ui-router As a Dependency

angular.module('App',['ui.router']);


Step 4: Configure Routes in .config Method

<script>
angular.module('App')
.config(RoutesConfig);

RoutesConfig.$inject = ['$stateProvider', '$urlRouterProvider'];
function RoutesConfig($stateProvider,$urlRouterProvider){
	...

	$urlRouterProvider
		.otherwise('/view1');

	$stateProvider
		.state('view1', {
			url: '/view1',
			templateUrl: 'view1.html'
		})

		.state('view2', {...});
	...

}
</script>

- otherwise is used when a url is used that doesn't match any of the preset ones. This defaults to a view, usually 404 page

IMPORTANT: you can class attribute: ui-sref on <a> tag or <button> tag to reference the state name and switch to that template

- another important directive/attribute you can use is ui-sref-active="someCSSclass" which allows you to apply stying to said element if your on its corresponding state


- ui-router uses independent concepts for URL mapping and UI state representation
- use <ui-view> tag as placeholder for state-based UI

- you can declare controller directly in definition of the state, also you can use controller as syntax



State Resolve Property
------------------------

Step 1: Set Up Resolve Property

<script>
	.state('view1', {
			url: '/view1',
			templateUrl: 'view1.html',
			controller: 'view1Ctrl as view1',
			resolve: {
				myData: ['Service', function(Service){
					return Service.getData();
				}]
			}
		});
</script>

- angular will inject the service 'Service' into said function
- Service.getData() returns a promise
- the resolution of everything is that the returned value will be injected into View1Ctrl as 'myData'


Step 2: Inject Resolve Property Into Controller

<script>
	View1Ctrl.$inject = ['myData'];
	function View1Ctrl(myData){
		var view1 = this;
		view1.myData = myData;
	}
</script>

- resolve properties DO NOT have to be promies, they could be a string or anything that we would want to inject into controller

- resolve property can be used to inject values directly into the controller responsible for the state

- if resolve property is a promise:
	- router will wait for it to resolve before transitioning to the state
	- if rejected, router will not transition to the new state at all
- the name of the key in the resolve's property object is what is to be injected into the corresponding controller's function
- resolve can have properties that contain anything: objects, strings, etc.



Using ui-router to map url parameters
----------------------------------------

State 1: Set up URL Property With Param(s)

<script>
	.state('view1', {
		url: '/view1/{param1}',
		templateUrl: 'view1.html',
		controller: 'View1Ctrl as view1',
		resolve: {
			myData: ['$stateParams', function($stateParams){
				return getDataBasedOn($stateParams.param1);
			}]
		}
	});
</script>

Step 2: Inject Resolve Property Into Controller

<script>
	View1Ctrl.$inject = ['myData'];
	function View1Ctrl(myData){
		var view1 = this;
		view1.myData = myData;
	}
</script>

If you want a ui-sref to transition to a state that expects parameters:

<a ui-sref="view1({itemId:someVal1})">Link to the view data</a>

- the name, 'itemId', must match the expected paramater exactly


- use $stateParams service to retrieve parameters
	- $stateParams.paramName

- Construct a URL with ui-sref directive:
	- ui-sref="stateName({paramName:value})"
