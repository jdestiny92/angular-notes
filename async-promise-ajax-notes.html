Before Promises We Had Callbacks!

<script>
	asyncFunction(function(){
		//do when asyncFunction is done
	})
</script>

- The problem is: there is no easy and straightforward way to pass the results of asyncFunction back to its caller
- Especially if the real recipient of the result is a few layers away (one service calling another service calling asyncFunction)
- Call Back Hell !!! Imagine three nested asyncFunctions. You have to wait for all of them to complete to use ANY of the results
- Very difficult to run these async functions in parrel or even deal with error handling


Promise (Angular Js and New ES6 API)
------------------------------------

- Object which can be passed around or returned that holds references to the outcome of asynchronous behavior.
- In Angular, promises are created through the $q service

<script>
	function asyncFunction(){
		// Creates async environment with all the hooks into it, including the promise object
		var deferred = $q.defer();

		// Marks succesful completion, wraps data for the promise
		if (...){
			deferred.resolve(result);
		};

		// Marks unsuccesful completion, wraps data for the promise
		else {
			deferred.reject(error);
		};

		// Returns promise to caller (a hook back to this entire process)
		return deferred.promise;
	}
</script>

- Keep in mind the if and else statements can be done asynchronously.
