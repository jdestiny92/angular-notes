Routing State with Nested Views
----------------------------------------------

Setting up Child (nested) State

<script >
	.state('view1.child', {
		url: '/detail/{param}',
		templateUrl: 'view1Detail.html'
	})
</script>

- this url gets concatinated with parent url


Inherited resolve Properties

parent state:
<script >
	.state('view1', {
		resolve: {
			myData: 'someVal';
		}
	})
</script>

child state:
<script>
	.state('view1.child', {
		controller: "ChildCtrl as child"
	})
</script>

- this allows you to inject 'mydata' into the controller so you do less server side calls, aka reusing same info

- you don't need to call it .'child' you can call it anything

Important: $stateParams is used to look up the item id in the url

- so you need to put another <ui-view> where you would want the child template to be

- instead of declaring a url paramter within the child state, you can delcare a params parameter: 

params {
	itemId: null
}

- nested states allow us to to logically represent nested views
- parent state template has a ui-view in its template for the child state's template to insert its HTML
- Child state name is usually declared with syntax 'parent.child'
- The optionally declared url of the child gets concatenated to the declared url of the parent

Important: the parent's resolve property is inherited by the child and is injectable directly into the child's controller


Router State Transition Events
--------------------------------------------

$stateChangeStart
- fires when state change transition begins

<script>
	$rootScope.$on('stateChangeStart', function(event, toState, toParams, fromState, fromParams, options){
		...
	})
</script>

- use this to fire off a spinner if you're waiting for code to work out


$stateChangeSuccess
- fired once the state transition is complete

<script>
	$rootScope.$on('stateChangeSuccess', function(event, toState, toParams, fromState, fromParams){
		...
	})
</script>

- notice the missing params at the end compared to last example

$stateChangeError
- fires when an error occurs during transition

<script>
	$rootScope.$on('stateChangeSuccess', function(event, toState, toParams, fromState, fromParams, error){
		...
	})
</script>

- notice the difference in the last parameter

- say you caught an error, in won't so up on console, thats why you use this

- you can use event.preventDefault() to prevent transition from occuring, referencing to stateChangeStart

- ui-router exposes numerous state change events that our code is able to listen for
- All ui-router events are fired on the $rootScope
