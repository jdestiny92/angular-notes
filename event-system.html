- Essentially, its difficult and messy to interact with multiple components on the DOM simultaneously
- At this time, only real solution is using a service to communicate between them
- However this is a design pattern that solves this:


publish-suscribe design pattern
--------------------------------

Publishers send messages to subscribers on a common channel
- Publishers:
	- Mark messages with a classifcation
	- Don't know subscribers or if there are any
- Subscribers:
	- Sign up to listen for messages with a particular classificaton
	- Don't know publishers or if there are any
- In Angular the common channel is scope
	- Messages are events that can hold data


Publishing an Event: $scope.$emit
- emit sends a messages to every part up the scope until there is nothing left to send to

Publishing an Event: $scope.$broadcast
- broadcast sends a message to every part down the scope uniti there is nothing left to send to

Listening for an Event: $scope.$on
- ex: $scope.$on('greet', handlerFunction);

Issue: What is you have two components that are neither descendents or ancestors?
	- You can use $rootscope.$broadcast, to send the information down the rootscope: html(ng-app)

Step 1: Brodcast or Emit an Event

<script>
	$scope.$broadcast('namespace:eventName', {prop:value});

	//namespace is used for code readability
</script>

Step 2: Listen for & Handle the Event

<script>
	$scope.$on('namespace:eventName', handler);

	function handler(event, data){
		if(data.prop==='val1'){
			...
		}
	};
</script>

- Publish-subscribe design pattern is implemented using the Angular Events system
- You can publish events from anywhere in the system and listen for those events anywhere in the system
- to listen for an event, either use $scope.$on or $rootScope.$on
- MUST deregister the listener when using $rootScope.$on
