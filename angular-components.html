Components only control their own view and data

	- Never modify data or DOM outside their own scope
	- Modifying creates side effects that lead to chaos
	- Therefore Angular components always use isolate scope 

Components have well defined public API - Inputs and Outputs
	- Inputs: use '<' and '@' bindings only
	- Never change property value of passed in object or array
	- Outputs: use '&' for component event callbacks
	- Pass data to callback through param map {key:val}

Components have well defined life cycle
	- $onInit = controller initialization code
	- $onChanges(changeObj) = called whenever one way bindings are changed
		- change.Obj.currentValue, changeObj.previousValue
	- $postLink = similar to 'link' in directive
	- $onDestroy = when scope is about to be destroyed

Application is a tree of components
	- Entire application should be comprised of components
	- Each one would have a well defined input and output
	- 2 way data binding is minimized as much as possible


Step 1: Register Component With Module & customize

<script>
	angular.module('app', [])
	.component('myComponent', {
		templateUrl: 'template.html',
		controller: CompController,
		bindings: {
			prop1: '<',
			prop2: '@',
			onAction: '&'
		}
	});
</script>

- almost always have a template
- not required to name controller. Empty function provided automatically, placed on scope with label '$ctrl'
- on component, scope is always isolate and cannot change
- 'bindings' object is the isolate scope param mapping definition


Step 2: Reference Props in Template

<div
	ng-click="$ctrl.onAction({myArg: 'val'})">
	{{ $ctrl.prop1.prop }} and {{ $ctrl.prop2 }}
</div>


Step 3: Use Component in HTML

<my-component
	prop1='val-1'
	prop2='@parentProp'
	on-action='parentFunction(myArg)'>

	{{ $ctrl.prop1.prop}} and {{$ctrl.prop2}}

</my-component>

- take note of camelCase with all lowercase and dash in between
- IMPORTANT: $ctrl is the label that represents our controller instance, similar to controllerAs syntax
- IMPORTANT: all the life cycles are function and the $postLink is used to manipulate the DOM

How to setup $postLink
----------------------

1. Inject $scope and $element into the controller that the component derives from
2. Then set up a watcher for a certain part or function that will be changed
3. Add a call back function that has the parameters 'newValue' and 'oldValue'
- Say for instance, you add jquery, $element references jquery instance

<script>
	$ctrl.$postLink= function(){
		$scope.$watch('$ctrl.cookiesInList()', function(newValue, oldValue){
			if(newValue===true){
				// When function activates do something
				var warningElem = $element.find('div.error');
				warningElem.slideDown(900);
			}
			else{
				//do something else
				var warningElem = $element.find('div.error');
				warningElem.slideUp(900);
			}
		});
	}
</script>


$doCheck
---------

- It is the last lifecycle method that executes through every iteration of the $digest loop
- Instead of using $postLink and having to inject $scope, you can use $doCheck instead

<script>
	$ctrl.$doCheck= function(){
		if($ctrl.items.length !== totalItems){
			totalItems = $ctrl.items.length;

			if($ctrl.cookiesInList()){
				var warningElem = $element.find('div.error');
				warningElem.slideDown(900);
			}
			else{
				var warningElem = $element.find('div.error');
				warningElem.slideUp(900);
			}
		}
	}
</script>

- Components should never modify data or DOM that doesn't belong to them
	- thats why it always has isolate scope and well defined API

- Provide Controller in component only if you need to add extra functionality
