IIFE = Immediately-Invoked Function Expression
	- it execultes immediately after its created
	- ensures that local variables do not bleed into global scope

<script>
	(function(){

	'use strict';	

	})();
</script>

use strict = stops random variables from populating the global scope, makes var keyword mandatory

Usual setup steps:
1. in app.js: 
	<script>
		angular.module('myFirstApp', [])

		.controller('myFirstCtrl', function($scope){
			$scope.name = "julian";

			$scope.alert = function(){
				return 'Hello World';
			}
		})
	</script>

2. Put ng-app onto first 'html' tag or 'body' tag


* You can put controllers on any tag for specific logic

3. Reference and use $scope within controller funciton

Use ng-model to reference variable within $scope
Can also be shown in view via {{}}

* you can use ng-keyup to call a function on every keypress!
