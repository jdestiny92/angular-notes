IIFE = Immediately-Invoked Function Expression
	- it execultes immediately after its created
	- ensures that local variables do not bleed into global scope

<script>
	(function(){

	'use strict';	

	})();
</script>

use strict = stops random variables from populating the global scope, makes var keyword mandatory

Usual setup steps:
1. in app.js: 
	<script>
		angular.module('myFirstApp', [])

		.controller('myFirstCtrl', function($scope){
			$scope.name = "julian";

			$scope.alert = function(){
				return 'Hello World';
			}
		})
	</script>

2. Put ng-app onto first 'html' tag or 'body' tag


* You can put controllers on any tag for specific logic

3. Reference and use $scope within controller funciton

Use ng-model to reference variable within $scope
Can also be shown in view via {{}}

* you can use ng-keyup to call a function on every keypress!



Dependency Injection
---------------------


$scope - Angular Js instantiates this object for us

We get access to it via a controller through dependency injection


Dependency Injection = design pattern that implements 'inversion of control' for resolving dependencies


Besides $scope, you can inject $filter, for example:

<script>
function DIcontroller ($scope, $filter){

	var upCase = $filter('uppercase');
	$scope.name = upCase($scope.name);
}

</script>


The service 'Injector' or '$injector' is what parses and sorts through the parameters which are injected into controllers


Expressions
-------------

Expression : {{ exp }}

- Something that evaluates some value
- Executed in the context of the scope and has access to properties on $scope
- Doesn't throw errors if it results in a TypeError or ReferenceError
- Control flow functions (like 'if' statements) are not allowed insides handlebars
- Accepts a filter or a filter chain to format the output


Interpolation
--------------

- Process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, which are replaced with values
- Still conected to the original 'message'  property
- If the $scope.message changes, so will the interpolation result



Can call functions from within expressions, example {{saySomething()}}


Expressions get interprolated as string literals and then concatinated, so:

You can have cool functionality like this:

<img src="images/yaakov_{{stateofBeing}}.png" >

Which wil switch dynamically with more functionality in reference to yaakov_fed.png and yaakov_hungry.png


Use ng-src instead of generic 'src' to let interpolation happen first.....
