Use controllers to:
	- set up initial state of $scope
	- add behavior to the $scope (handle events that effect the view state)

DO NOT use controllers to:
	- handle business logic directly
	- share code or state across other controllers


Singleton Design Pattern
-------------------------

Restricts an object to always have a single instance.
	- Each dependent component will get a reference to the same instance
	- Multiple controllers injected with a Service will all have access to the same service instance
	- This allows us to share data across different components (ie controllers) throughout application


Lazily Instantiated
--------------------

The service is only created if an application component declares it as a dependency
	- If no components in our application our dependent on this service, it will never get created
