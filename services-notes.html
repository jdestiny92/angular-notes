Use controllers to:
	- set up initial state of $scope
	- add behavior to the $scope (handle events that effect the view state)

DO NOT use controllers to:
	- handle business logic directly
	- share code or state across other controllers


Singleton Design Pattern
-------------------------

Restricts an object to always have a single instance.
	- Each dependent component will get a reference to the same instance
	- Multiple controllers injected with a Service will all have access to the same service instance
	- This allows us to share data across different components (ie controllers) throughout application


Lazily Instantiated
--------------------

The service is only created if an application component declares it as a dependency
	- If no components in our application our dependent on this service, it will never get created



Factory Design Pattern
----------------------

Central place that produces new objects or functions
	- Can produce any type of object, not just a Singleton
	- Can be used to produce dynamically customizable services


Factory vs Service Confusion
-----------------------------

.factory() is NOT just another way of creating the same service you can create with .service() but it CAN BE.

.service() is also a factory, but much more limited one compared to .factory(). It's a factory that always produces
the same type of service - a singleton, without an easy way to configure its behavior.


How to instantiate? - Similar to service:

.factory('CustomService', CustomService);

1. You use 'CustomService' to inject into other services, controllers, etc...
2. The CustomService variable or parameter is supposed to be a function that is expected to PRODUCE a service, not one that is already a service, as contrasted by the .service instantiation.


2 Ways To Go About Making a Factory:

1. <script>
		function createFactory(){
			var factory = {

				getSomeService: function(){
					return new someService();
				}
			};

			return factory;
		}
</script>

2. <script>
		function createFactory(){
			var factory = function(){

				return new someService();
			};

			return factory;
		}
</script>

In the end, you're either return a function or an object literal that has a key attached to a function as a value;

1. <script>
	var someSrv = CustomService.getSomeService();
	someSrv.method();
</script>

2. <script>
	var someSrv = CustomService();
	someSrv.method();
</script>



.provider()
--------------

.provider() is the the most verbose, but most flexible among .service() and .factory()
	- configure a factory not just at time of use, but at app bootstrapping

.provider('name', function)
	- whatever the 'name' is, thats what gets injected into other components

.config() function gets called BEFORE any service, factory, or controller is instantiated
	- therefore we can't inject any reguar components into .config
	- we CAN inject the provider of service with the (name + 'Provider')

Angular documentation states that .provider is actually gets called behind the scenes when we call .service or .factory


STEP 1: DEFINE PROVIDER FUNCTION
---------------------------------

<script>
	function ServiceProvider(){
		var provider = this;
		provider.config = {...};

		provider.$get = function(){
			var service = new Service(provider.config.prop);

			return service;
		};
	}
</script>


STEP 2: REGISTER PROVIDER FUNCTION WITH MODULE
-----------------------------------------------

<script>
	angular.module('app', [])
	.controller('ctrl', Ctrl)
	.provider('Service', ServiceProvider);

	//Name of 'Service' will be injected, name of function does not matter
</script>


STEP 3: INJECT IT AS USUAL
---------------------------

<script>
	Ctrl.$inject = ['$scope', 'Service'];

	function Ctrl($scope, Service){
		Service.someMethod();
	}
</script>


STEP 4a (Optional): Register Config Function
--------------------------------------------

<script>
	angular.module('app', [])
	.controller('ctrl', Ctrl)
	.provider('Service', ServiceProvider)
	.config(Config);
</script>


Step 4b (Optional): Inject Provider into Config
-------------------------------------------------

<script>
	Config.$inject = ['ServiceProvider'];
	// This stems from 'Service' + name 'Provider'

	function Config(ServiceProvider){
		ServiceProvider.config.prop = 'value';
	}
</script>
